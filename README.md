textfordirections
=================

Get directions via text.

Uses the Twilio and GoogleMaps API.

Points the Twilio number to a webserver on Heroku.

Text the number with the format "current location;type of place"
  This takes your current location, finds the closest of the type of place you want to go to, and gives you directions.
  Good for users without a smart phone, or with no signal trying to find the nearest gas station, etc.
